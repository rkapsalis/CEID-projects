# 1st exercise
## Part A
1. Implementation of Lloyd Max algorithm for non-uniform quantization.
2. Implementation of ADM encoder and decoder.
## Part B  
1. Implementation of M-PAM mapper, modulator, demodulator, decision device, demapper and AWGN channel.
2. BER (Bit Error Rate) graphs for PAM-4 and for PAM-8 (with gray encoding) (𝑆𝑁𝑅=0:2:20𝑑𝐵). 
3. SER (Symbol Error Rate) graphs for PAM-4 and for PAM-8 (𝑆𝑁𝑅=0:2:20𝑑𝐵).

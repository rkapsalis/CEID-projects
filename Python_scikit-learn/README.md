# Document Similarity and TOP-K most similar documents
Similarity among documents, using the Cosine Similarity measure, is calculated. First, user is asked to give the exact filepaths of documents, then a matrix containing similarities among documents is shown on screen. Then the user is asked to give the k for the top-k most similar documents and if scipy.special.binom(n, 2)<=k then top-k most similar documents are shown.
